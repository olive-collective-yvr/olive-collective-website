<small>
    - We stand for collective liberation.</small><br>
<small>
    - We stand for anticapitalism (aim to fulfill everyone’s needs and not to generate profit), anticolonialism, decolonization
(not in the co-opted sense of the term), antiracism, antispeciesm, antihomophobia, antitransphobia, 0 tolerance for sexual violence, and anti-ableist.</small><br>
<small>
    - We are non-hierarchical and welcoming, and we encourage learning and activism. There are no stupid questions.</small><br>
<small>
    - Be charitable. Start by assuming good intentions from others. Try to facilitate discussion rather than making accusations or attacks.</small><br>
<small>
    - Emphasize community and making decisions together.</small><br>
<small>
    - Actively encourage building connections.</small><br>
<small>
    - Do not engage in unwanted romantic pursuit. Develop a strong consent and respect culture.</small><br>
<small>
    - Ask for explicit consent (e.g. shaking hands, hugs).</small><br>
<small>
    - If you see something, say something (in a non law enforcement way). Don’t be a bystander.</small><br>
<small>
    - Emphasize community care and checking in on each other (e.g. checking on people’s energy levels, respecting hosts).</small><br>
<small>
    - Everyone is empowered to create their own action, to contribute, and to share responsibility. Be aware of people’s capacity.</small><br>
<small><br>
<b>Inspired by FreeSkool Vancouver:</b><br>
        - Everyone has wisdom, and we need everyone’s wisdom for the wisest results.<br>
            - Seek first to understand, then to be understood.<br>
                - Speak for yourself, not others.<br>
                    - One person speaks at a time.<br>
                        - Share the air-time -- Stand up. Stand back.<br>
                            - Use "i" statements. Be critical, not judgemental.<br>
                                - Do not personalize conflict.<br>
                                    - You can change your mind.<br>
                                        - Personal stories stay in the room, but learnings should be shared.<br>
                                            - Hold each other accountable.<br>
                                                - Ensure your access needs are met.<br>
        - Have fun!<small>
