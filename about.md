The OLIVE Collective is a community committed to the shared struggles for liberation for everyone—all sentient beings
from human to non-human animals. We recognize the interconnectedness of oppressive systems and their particular linkages
to animal oppression. Our local community is situated on the unceded lands of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh
(Squamish), and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) peoples in so-called Vancouver, BC.

Our approach to liberation centres on anti-oppression principles and the vegan ethics that treat non-human animals as the
persons they are, who cannot be reduced to products or commodities for consumption. We refuse to see them as inferior to
human animals. We also acknowledge that much of the violence and exploitations humans experience are products of
[systems of oppression interlocking](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-55425-3_17) with those of non-human
animals. For example, racism is deeply tied to the human-animal binary and the hierarchy that treats certain groups as subhuman.
Slaughterhouses, driven by capitalism's pursuit for profit, not only kill non-human animals but also exploit marginalized and
racialized workers, inflicting significant psychological harm on them. Ultimately, systems of oppression such as racism, sexism,
and speciesism are all constitutive of hierarchy, domination, and [discrimination](https://www.animal-ethics.org/speciesism/).

Actions toward liberation must happen everyday. As part of our everyday political practice, we exclude the consumption of
animals and their bodily products—such as meat, dairy, fur, and leather—as much as possible and practicable. We also try
our best to avoid buying products tied to other forms of exploitation, such as those involving human child labor or causing
significant environmental harm. Beyond this, we actively organize and take action on a wide range of social justice issues,
including advocating for Indigenous land sovereignty, workers’ rights, climate and environmental justice, and the liberation of Palestine.

<b>Inspired by FreeSkool Vancouver:</b><br>
        - Everyone has wisdom, and we need everyone’s wisdom for the wisest results.<br>
            - Seek first to understand, then to be understood.<br>
                - Speak for yourself, not others.<br>
                    - One person speaks at a time.<br>
                        - Share the air-time -- Stand up. Stand back.<br>
                            - Use "I" statements. Be critical, not judgemental.<br>
                                - Do not personalize conflict.<br>
                                    - You can change your mind.<br>
                                        - Personal stories stay in the room, but learnings should be shared.<br>
                                            - Hold each other accountable.<br>
                                                - Ensure your access needs are met.<br>
        - Have fun!<small>
