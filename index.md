We are an anti-speciesist, grassroots group of collective liberationists dedicated to animal rights,
veganism, human rights, and decolonization.

We aim to raise awareness and inspire action on the intersections of different forms of oppressions, including but not limited to: speciesism, racism, capitalism, colonialism, imperialism, racism, sexism, and queerphobia. Our community is a space for education, growth, solidarity, and action!

Whether you're an activist in any social justice space wanting to learn more about animal ethics and speciesism, an animal advocate wanting to bridge the gap between animal rights and human rights advocacy, new to the concept of collective liberation, or a long-time collective liberationist, we would love for you to join us in building community and a movement for true justice and total liberation.
